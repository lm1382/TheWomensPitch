The Women's Pitch 

My project, The Women’s Pitch, is focused on developing an interactive and engaging website dedicated to women’s football.The aim of this is to increase engagement, promote awareness and address current issues within the sport. The website, hosted on Brighton Domains, combines an intuitive design aimed at all ages, interactive elements, and data-driven features to create a comprehensive site for users. This project aims to address the current gap in the representation of women’s football through multi-media content with a keen focus on accessibility and user experience.
