      <p>
        Despite women’s football's incredible growth in recent years,
        the sport continues to face significant challenges that need attention and addressing.
         From the prevention of career-stopping injuries to equitable funding, these issues faced highlight
         the gaps that still need addressing in order for the sport to continue to thrive.

            <h2>1920</h2>
            <p>During World War One, when women were increasingly taking on more traditional male jobs such as working in factories, football became a natural outlet as many factories developed teams. This led to the creation of one of the most successful factory teams— <b>the Dick, Kerr Ladies.</b></p>

            <div id="timeline1-popup" class="popup-text" style="display: none;">
                <p>On Boxing Day 1920, 53,000 people gathered to watch the Dick Kerr Ladies play St Helen’s at Goodison Park. By the end of 1920, women’s football was attracting a lot of attention, often bigger than the lower league men’s teams.</p>

    <h2>1921</h2>
    <p>On December 5th 1921, The FA announced a ban on the women’s game from being played at professional grounds and pitches affiliated with the FA.</p>

    <div id="timeline2-popup" class="popup-text" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            The FA claimed football was "unsuitable for women" and this decision sidelined women’s football for nearly 50 years, stunting its development and ultimately causing it to fall behind the men's game.

      <h2>1971</h2>
      <p>The ban was finally lifted following the formation of the Women's Football Association (WFA) a couple of years earlier.</p>

          <p>
              In 1969 the Women’s FA was formed which triggered change within the sport.
              The lifting of the ban meant women’s football could now be played on FA-affiliated 
              grounds again with registered referees officiating. The same year the ban was lifted came 
              the first women’s FA Cup final followed by the first official women’s internation match being played in 1972.

      <h2>2018</h2>
      <p>In September 2018, the Women’s Super League became a full-time professional league- 
      this meant it was now a 1-tier, 11-team league. This included familiar names Arsenal, Brighton 
      and Hove Albion and Chelsea.</p>

              In March of 2019, Barclays were announced as the official title sponsor of the WSL.
              This was the biggest investment in women’s sport by a brand in the UK ever. In the same season,
              a 12th team was added making it the 12-team league we now know.

    <h2>Key Issues in Women's Football</h2>

    <section class="issues-container">
    <div class="issue-card" id="acl-injuries">
    <h3><i>ACL Injuries</i></h3>
    <p>ACL injuries are a prevalent issue in women’s football with the number of players facing this injury increasing. 
    Female players are 25% less likely to make a full recovery and return to the game compared to their male counterparts. 
    With the rapid growth in the game's professionalism comes an increase in physical demands on players.</p>
    <button class="popup-btn" data-popup-open="acl-popup">Read More</button>
    <div id="acl-popup" class="popup-text" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            With nearly 30 players (enough for an entire squad) missing the 2023 Women’s World Cup
            due to ACL injuries and incidence up to 8x higher in females, research is continually being 
            carried out around why the injury risk is so much higher. This could be related to a women’s
            menstrual cycle, biomechanics of the female body and even environmental factors such as poor
            quality pitches and boots designed for men.

    <div class="issue-card" id="broadcasting">
    <h3><i>Broadcasting</i></h3>
    <p>The progression in broadcasting rights reflects the WSL’s journey from exposure being 
    very limited to becoming more prominent in mainstream sporting media. Challenges initially included 
    competition with men’s football for broadcast time and overcoming the perceptions that women’s
    sport would not draw large audiences. </p>

        <p>
           A new deal, signed in 2024, sees a five-year rights extension with BBC
           and Sky Sports which is the most significant broadcast partnership seen for women’s 
           football in the UK. This new deal is worth approximately £65 million according to 
           reports and will begin for the 2025/26 season. This includes extended coverage of WSL matches, 
           aired live on both BBC and Sky sports platforms which will significantly expand the reach of the league.

    <div class="issue-card" id="underfunding">
    <h3><i>Underfunding</i></h3>
    <p>Funding in women’s football has historically lagged behind the men’s game.
    This impacts salaries, facilities, grassroots development and more. 
    Along with significant inequalities in salaries, prize money inequality also persists with an
    almost $330 million difference in World Cup prize funds between men and women.

    <div id="underfunding-popup" class="popup-text" style="display: none;">
        <p>
           Grassroots and youth development programs often struggle with underfunding
           with limited access to academies for young girls compared to boys.
           As of a 2022 report, only 63% of schools in the UK offered equal access to football for girls.
           Following the 2022 Women’s Euros win by the Lioness’s, 23 players put pen to paper and demanded equal access.
           Following this, the government announced a huge £30 million investment into creating a new Lionesses Futures Fun.
